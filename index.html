		<h1>Americana</h1>
		<h2>Offspring</h2>

	<p>	Now give me my cable, fast food, 
four-by's, tat's right away 
I want it right now cause 
my generation don't like to wait 
My future's determined by 
Thieves, thugs, and vermin 
It's quite an excursion 
But it's okay
    </p> 
	
	
<p>
	Everything's backwards 
In americana my way 

Well, fuck you!
Well my dream has come true 
My vision has come true

</p>
